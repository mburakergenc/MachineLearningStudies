# Introduction
There are two definitions of *Machine Learning*. First Machine learning is a science of getting computers learn without being explicitly programmed. 

and the second definition is provided by Tom Mitchell. He explains Machine Learning as

 > A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
 
 We can give playing checkers as an example. I such example; <br>
*  **E would be:** The experience of playing many games<br>
*  **T would be:** the task of playing checkers<br>
*  **P would be:** The probability that the program will win the next game.

## Examples of Machine Learning that We Use in Our Daily Lives
Google's searching(or pageranking) algorithm would probably be the most frequenlty used example. Everyday when we make searches on Google, there is a pageranking algorithm that analyses each website's backlinks, unique contents and some other SEO rules then it returns the best results in a descending form.
